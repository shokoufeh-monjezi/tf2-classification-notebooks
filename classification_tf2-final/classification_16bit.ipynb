    "Usually, you just need to adjust `prune.threshold` for accuracy and model size trade off. Higher `threshold` gives you smaller model (and thus higher inference speed) but worse accuracy. The threshold to use is depend on the dataset. 0.68 is just a starting point. If the retrain accuracy is good, you can increase this value to get smaller models. Otherwise, lower this value to get better accuracy."
